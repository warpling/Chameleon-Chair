Chameleon Chair (~~Presence Bench~~)
=======================

Our project morphed a lot over the past few weeks. We went from wanting to make a public installation in a bustling subway to realizing we had neither the time nor resources to do something so ambitious without at least first creating a small scale prototype. Our original idea was to create a subway bench installment that would light bright RGB LEDs under the seat the longer a user sat and slowly fad away after they left, leaving a sort of mark representing their past presence in time. We intended to study how people interacted with the bench and discovered what was happening as well as how people entering the station right after a subway has left, would react the slowly fading out light left behind.

This chair prototype demonstrates the main action of the bench on a small scale and also adds an additional feature: matching the color of the wearerâ€™s shirt/jacket. This video demonstrates the desired action of the chair but is not the final working version.
