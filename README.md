Presence-Bench-Lighting
=======================

Physical Interaction Project at KTH for DH2400. The purpose of this project is to make a ~~public installation of a bench~~ **chair**, which is lit-up different colors with RGB LEDs based on ~~where, and how long people sit on the bench~~ the color of the clothing the sitter is wearing.

*(We had to change our project to this version because of time-constraints working with SL to get permisison to work on their subway benches!)*

A checklist of some things we need to do to make this project a reality:
<ul>
	<li>~~Order RGB LEDs, drives, temperature sensors, wiring, enclosures, etc~~</li>
	<li>Refine RGB control code, temperature readings, calibration, and other tweaks</li>
	<li>Learn how to multiplex analog inputs from sensors, and ouputs to LEDs or get Ardunio Mega?</li>
	<li>Figure out how to best document people using the chair</li>
</ul>
